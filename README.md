This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Learn More

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

## 🌍 Localization & I18n Rules

This project uses a strict localization system. **Hardcoding strings in Arabic or English within the UI or server actions is strictly prohibited.**

### The Rule
- All user-facing text must reside in `src/messages/ar.json` and `src/messages/en.json`.
- Use the `useTranslation()` hook in client components to access the `dict` object.
- Pass the `dict` object to sub-components that need it.
- For server components/actions, use keys and let the client handle translation, or use `getDictionary()` from `@/lib/i18n-server`.

### Verification
Future code audits will flag any hardcoded Arabic characters or non-localized English UI labels.
